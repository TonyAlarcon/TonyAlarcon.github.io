    <p> 
	My name is Pedro Alarcon but I go by Tony, which is short for my middle name. 
	I graduated with an Astrophysics degree from UCLA in 2018, and subsequently enhanced my education through post-bacc 
	programs and community college coursework. I posses a vigorous mathematical foundation with exposure to concepts in 
	Machine Learning, Data Structures, Operating Systems and Electromechanics. As further elaborated in my resume, I’ve 
	engaged in undergraduate research, managed team projects and conducted numerous experiments that’s given me a good 
	grounding of theory and application within a computer science contex
